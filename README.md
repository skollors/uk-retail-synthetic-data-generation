# Synthetic Data Generation Demo — UK Retail Dataset

Welcome to this comprehensive synthetic data generation demo repository! This project showcases how to create realistic synthetic datasets using real-world tabular data, here demonstrated on a UK retail dataset with columns such as:

- Country  
- CustomerID  
- UnitPrice  
- InvoiceDate  
- Quantity  
- StockCode  

Whether you work in **healthcare, education technology, finance, or retail**, synthetic data generation is a crucial tool for enhancing data privacy, enabling robust machine learning, and accelerating data-driven innovation.

## Why Synthetic Data Generation?

Synthetic data generation enables organizations to:

- **Preserve data privacy and comply with regulations** like GDPR and HIPAA by generating fully synthetic datasets that mimic real data patterns without exposing sensitive information.  
- **Boost AI and machine learning development** by augmenting limited datasets and reducing model bias.  
- **Improve software testing and development cycles** with scalable, realistic data that doesn’t rely on production databases.  
- **Facilitate data sharing and collaboration** across teams and organizations without data governance risks.

This demo project offers a starting point to understand synthetic data concepts, techniques, and evaluation metrics.

## About the UK Retail Dataset

The UK retail dataset serves as an example dataset containing transactional data with features common to many business domains:

| Column Name | Description                   |
|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Country     | Country of the transaction     |
| CustomerID  | Unique customer identifier     |
| UnitPrice   | Price per item                 |
| InvoiceDate | Date of invoice               |
| Quantity    | Number of items purchased      |
| StockCode   | Product stock keeping unit code |

These columns make this dataset ideal for demonstrating synthetic data generation workflows for tabular data.
